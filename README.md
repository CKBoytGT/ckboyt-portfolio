# C. K. Boyt Code Portfolio
Professional portfolio to display code projects. Uses graphic design assets from my pre-existing personal rebrand project.

## Features
- **About section:** Includes photo, name, and a brief bio.
- **Work section:** Uses a flexbox-based image gallery to display titled screenshots of projects that link to each deployed site. Includes a gradient overlay and hover effects. First project displays larger on desktop/laptop. Changes to a column format for tablet/mobile.
- **Contact section:** Displays contact links as buttons with hover effects.
- **Responsiveness:** Changes from a left-aligned desktop/laptop design to a centered tablet/mobile design at a 912px breakpoint.

## Screenshot
